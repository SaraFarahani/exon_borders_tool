exon_borders_tool

Description

This is a tool consisting of three different modules, each with an individual functionality described below:
import_from_ensembl - imports nucleotide data from the ensembl.org's databases into a local database. The exons' start and end positions are converted from chromosome coordinates to transcript coordinates.
insert_gene_families - reads a CSV-file containing gene families and inserts data to a database.
write_gene_families - constructs a FASTA formatted textfile of gene families containing nucleotide data including the exons' transcript coordinates.
